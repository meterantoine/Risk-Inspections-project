# Risk-Inspections-project
To see the users location just tap on the annotation.

To center the user again you can press on the blue arrow on the far right side.

Inspections are filtered by risk2 and risk3

have some animations with the table View but it doen't display data at the moment.

*Testing* works best if you use an iphone device, the simulator works as well but it has problems with userlocation so you would have to set a default location for the simulator.
